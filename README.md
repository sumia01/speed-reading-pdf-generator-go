#Â speed-reading-pdf-generator-go

This small script is made for one of my friends.
Her request was to generate a pdf from txt files that contain one word per page.
That's all that this script does, nothing more.

## usage

put your input text files into the `In` folder and run the program. It will generate PDF(s) to the `Out` folder.
